## _An App to log and track your dreams._# ðŸŒš ðŸŒ‘

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) that allows users to log a description of their dreams, along with how the dream made them feel, and the date of the dream. Dream logs include a dream title which is used to generate a custom dream image with the help of the [`Pexels API`](https://www.pexels.com/) that will be displayed on the history page when retreiving the dream entry.

When user's register to use the application they are asked to select their astrological sign. This is used to generate a daily horoscope on the splash page after logging in. This horoscope is generated by the [`The Horoscope API`](https://horoscope-app-api.vercel.app/).
